The two technology stacks we're using is Node.js and MongoDB. We chose Node.js as we had basic understanding of javascript
and thought it wouldn't be too big of a leap to learn properly. Node.js is also very popular and lots of resources are
available for it such as packages and tutorials. We also chose MongoDB as it seemed very beginner friendly as we already knew
how JSON formatting worked and the data that we got from the API is in JSON form, where we could easily insert it into our database.
