# CS411 B4 Group2 Project - ArtGuessr

Collaborative project between Karim Benromdhane, Simon Kye, Mustafa Taybah, and Michael Walsh

This project was created as part of CS411 at Boston University under Professor Donham in the Fall semester of 2022.

Current iteration includes google account integration and score tracking.

Code is designed to run both frontend and backend locally, with a nodejs instance running the backend (app.js), and the frontend being browser-based.

This project uses the following APIs: MET Collection API (https://metmuseum.github.io), Google Maps API (https://developers.google.com/maps), and Google Geocoding (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding).
